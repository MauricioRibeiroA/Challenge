# Challenge
Webiste

Inside /docs directory I developed a better website, but with the github pages requirements it´s more difficult to run js and css because of the HTTPS and I lost the references for the files because now they´re hosted in Github.
I´ll keep developing and find out a way to solve this problem. 
For now I wrote the index.html and the secondpage.html to finish the 2.5 Solo Challenge Personal.
